CyberSecurity Anomaly Detection Using Machine Learning : Ransomwares
Our project, "Conquering Ransomware with Dynamic Analysis and Machine Learning," is a groundbreaking initiative aimed at combating the relentless threat of ransomware with unparalleled precision. At its core, we've harnessed the power of dynamic analysis, envisioning a cutting-edge forensics lab for software, meticulously scrutinizing its behavior during execution.

Picture this: isolated virtual environments, or sandboxes, where suspicious software is run and closely monitored. This allows us to capture the true essence of the software's interactions with the operating system, network, and files – akin to capturing its unique behavioral fingerprints.

But we didn't stop there. We meticulously prepared this behavioral data, transforming it into a format ripe for machine learning algorithms to digest. Through a rigorous feature selection process, we handpicked 24 features of utmost relevance, ensuring our dataset was primed for the battlefield of machine learning.

Speaking of machine learning, we've employed a formidable arsenal of algorithms. From Random Forests to Support Vector Machines and XGBoost, each algorithm underwent rigorous testing. But it was the Random Forest algorithm that emerged as our champion, boasting an exceptional 96% accuracy on unseen data – a testament to its prowess in identifying even the most elusive ransomware variants.
